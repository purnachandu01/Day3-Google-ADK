    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "*   **Literature Mining:** AI can analyze vast amounts of scientific literature to identify emerging targets or connections between genes and diseases.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models can assess the likelihood that a newly identified target can actually be modulated by a drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Accelerating Preclinical Testing and Prediction:**\n",
      "AI is making the early stages of drug development faster and more efficient:\n",
      "*   **Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI can analyze preclinical data (in vitro and in vivo) to predict how well a drug candidate will work and what its potential side effects might be, reducing the number of compounds that fail later.\n",
      "*   **Optimizing Clinical Trial Design:** AI can help identify the most suitable patient populations for trials, predict patient response rates, and even suggest optimal dosing regimens. This can lead to faster and more successful trials.\n",
      "*   **\"In Silico\" Experiments:** AI models can simulate the behavior of drug molecules in biological systems, reducing the need for some costly and time-consuming physical experiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **AI for Target Identification and Validation**. This is a critical, often overlooked, but incredibly impactful area where AI is making waves in drug discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a deeper dive:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Challenge of Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "For decades, identifying the right biological target (like a specific protein or gene) that, when modulated by a drug, can effectively treat a disease has been a major bottleneck. It often involves:\n",
      "*   **Deep biological expertise:** Understanding complex cellular pathways.\n",
      "*   **Extensive laboratory experiments:** Testing hypotheses that can take months or years.\n",
      "*   **Serendipity:** Sometimes, targets are discovered by chance.\n",
      "*   **Risk:** Many identified targets turn out not to be \"druggable\" or don't lead to effective treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI tackles this challenge by its ability to process and find patterns in massive, diverse datasets that are far beyond human capacity to analyze manually.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Leveraging 'Omics Data (Genomics, Proteomics, Transcriptomics, etc.):**\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** These are fields that generate vast amounts of data about an organism's genes (genomics), proteins (proteomics), RNA (transcriptomics), and metabolites (metabolomics).\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:** AI algorithms can:\n",
      "        *   **Identify aberrant genes/proteins:** Find genetic mutations or protein expression levels that are consistently altered in diseased cells compared to healthy ones.\n",
      "        *   **Uncover novel pathways:** Map out complex biological pathways and identify previously unknown nodes (potential targets) within them that are critical for disease progression.\n",
      "        *   **Integrate multiple 'Omics datasets:** Combine information from different types of 'omics data to build a more holistic picture of the disease biology, revealing synergistic interactions that are key to identifying effective targets.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** If AI analyzes genomic data from thousands of cancer patients and finds a specific gene mutation is highly correlated with poor prognosis, that gene (or the protein it produces) becomes a strong candidate for a therapeutic target.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Advanced Literature Mining and Knowledge Graph Construction:**\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** The scientific literature is a treasure trove of biological knowledge, but it's also immense and constantly growing. AI can read and understand scientific papers, patents, and clinical trial data.\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:**\n",
      "        *   **Extracting relationships:** AI can identify connections between genes, proteins, diseases, drugs, and biological processes mentioned across millions of documents.\n",
      "        *   **Building knowledge graphs:** These AI-generated networks visually represent these relationships, allowing researchers to explore connections and discover hidden insights.\n",
      "        *   **Hypothesis generation:** By connecting seemingly unrelated pieces of information, AI can propose novel hypotheses about potential drug targets.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** An AI might read thousands of papers on inflammation and arthritis, cross-reference them with databases on cellular signaling, and identify a specific receptor that's been implicated in inflammation but never considered as a direct target for arthritis treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** Not every identified biological target can be effectively modulated by a small molecule drug or antibody. Some targets have difficult-to-access binding sites, or modulating them has unintended consequences.\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:** AI models can be trained on data from known druggable and non-druggable targets to predict, for a newly identified target, how likely it is to yield a successful drug. This saves significant resources by weeding out \"undruggable\" targets early.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Analyzing Real-World Evidence (RWE) and Clinical Data:**\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** Data from electronic health records (EHRs), insurance claims, and patient registries can provide insights into how diseases progress and how patients respond to different treatments in real-world settings.\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:** AI can analyze this vast and often messy data to:\n",
      "        *   **Identify patient subgroups:** Discover specific patient populations that might respond better to a particular therapeutic approach, hinting at underlying biological targets unique to those groups.\n",
      "        *   **Find unexpected associations:** Identify links between certain conditions or outcomes that might point to novel therapeutic targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact and Benefits:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Speed:** AI can analyze data and generate hypotheses in days or weeks, compared to months or years of manual effort.\n",
      "*   **Novelty:** AI can uncover targets that human researchers might miss due to cognitive biases or the sheer complexity of the data.\n",
      "*   **Efficiency:** By identifying better targets upfront and predicting their druggability, AI reduces the number of failed drug development programs, saving billions of dollars.\n",
      "*   **Precision:** AI enables a move towards more precise medicine by identifying targets relevant to specific patient subtypes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies like **Recursion Pharmaceuticals**, **BenevolentAI**, and **Exscientia** are heavily focused on using AI for target discovery and validation as a core part of their drug development platforms. They often partner with major pharmaceutical companies to leverage their expertise in identifying promising new avenues for drug development.\n",
      "\n",

    "1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n",
    "2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n",
